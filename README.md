**"JavaScript is a powerful programming language. But as it continues to evolve, outdated code gets messy and difficult to maintain. That’s where TypeScript comes in. It builds on your JavaScript foundation so you can develop higher-quality, less error-prone code faster. As a TypeScript developer, you’ll be in higher demand and gain a competitive edge in the work world." - Codecademy.com**

This repository contains solutions to all exercises in the Codecademy course [Learn Typescript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-typescript). I posted these solutions here for those of us who tends to forget the most basic parts of Typescript sometimes.
